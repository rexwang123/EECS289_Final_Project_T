# EECS289_Final_Project_T
Week 10 of EECS16ML covers the topic of Natural Language Processing. In order to transform text into fixed-length and numerical form that computer algorithms favor, and at the same time retaining the rich meanings included in the context, several word embedding techniques have been developed to meet the challenge. We hope students to understand both types of count-based and predictive methods along with several popular algorithms in our repository. 

## Learning Objective
  * Count-based
    * Bag of Words
    * TFIDF
    * Co-occurance matrix
  
  * Predictive
    * Word2Vec
    * GloVe
