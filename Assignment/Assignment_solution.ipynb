    "In this assignment, you are going to implement and apply the word embedding techniques you learn from notes and slides. Here, we introduce a real world machine learning task - sentiment analysis of movie reviews with binary classification. We have cleaned and pre-processed the data for you so that the dataset you have is a set of lists of words, where each list represents a single movie review.  \n",

    "In each part, you are going to first implement a specific embedding technique from scratch, then practice utilizing existing packages that implement the same embedding technique for you. Finally, you will apply the embeddings on the movie reviews data and use a classification algorithm (here we will use linear support vector machine) to classify your embedded reviews. Make observation of the classification accuracies you achieve with each embedding technique and/or hyperparamters you use."

It was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. It is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks. If you are interested in the details of the Bert model, you can refer to their paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf"
